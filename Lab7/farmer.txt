is used when an attempted move results in a bad pairing.

d) The Jealous Husbands Problem consists of couples wanting to cross a river, with a boat that can carry up to 3 people at one time.
The husbands in each couple are jealous, and will not allow a woman to be with another man unless her husband is also present. This means
that women cannot outnumber the men on either side of the river, as that would mean some women are without their husbands.
